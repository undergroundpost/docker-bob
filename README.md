## Architecture

### Backend Technology
The system is built with Rust and Axum for several key advantages:

- **Performance**: Rust provides near-C performance with 10x faster request handling than Node.js
- **Memory Safety**: Zero-cost abstractions prevent memory leaks and crashes
- **Concurrency**: Excellent async performance for handling 100+ concurrent users  
- **Type Safety**: Compile-time error checking prevents runtime failures
- **Small Footprint**: Docker images under 20MB vs 500MB+ for Node.js applications

### Database & Storage
- **PostgreSQL with pgvector**: Production-grade database with vector similarity search
- **Redis**: Caching and session management
- **MinIO**: S3-compatible object storage for file uploads
- **Full ACID compliance** with proper transaction handling

### Infrastructure
- **Docker Compose**: Multi-service orchestration with health checks
- **Structured logging**: Request tracing and error monitoring
- **Security headers**: Protection against common web vulnerabilities
- **Input validation**: SQL injection and XSS prevention

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose
- OpenAI API key (for lead generation)
- Apollo.io API key (for contact enrichment)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/undergroundpost/docker-bob.git
   cd docker-bob
   ```

2. Start with Docker Compose
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. Access the application at `http://localhost:3000`

The application automatically initializes all required services and databases.

### API Key Configuration

Navigate to Settings â†’ Leadgen to configure:
- OpenAI API Key for AI company generation
- Apollo.io API Key for contact data enrichment
- Generation parameters (max companies, request delays, prompts)

## Core API Endpoints

### Contact Management
- `GET /api/contacts` - List contacts with filtering
- `POST /api/contacts` - Create new contact
- `PUT /api/contacts/:id` - Update contact
- `DELETE /api/contacts/:id` - Delete contact
- `POST /api/contacts/bulk-delete` - Bulk deletion
- `POST /api/contacts/bulk-contact` - Bulk communication logging

### Lead Generation
- `GET /api/leadgen/config` - Configuration management
- `POST /api/leadgen/run` - Start AI workflow
- `GET /api/leadgen/progress` - Real-time progress
- `GET /api/leadgen/sessions` - Session history

### Data Operations
- `POST /api/upload` - File import
- `GET /api/export` - CSV export
- `GET /api/dashboard` - Metrics and analytics
- `GET /api/activities` - Activity timeline

## Lead Generation Workflow

The AI lead generation follows a four-step process:

1. **Company Generation**: OpenAI generates target company lists based on configurable prompts
2. **Company Verification**: Web-based validation to ensure companies exist
3. **Blacklist Filtering**: Automatic exclusion of existing customers and scraped data
4. **Contact Enrichment**: Apollo.io API enriches companies with contact information

All steps include progress tracking, error handling, and session management.

## Database Schema

Core tables include:
- `contacts` - Contact information with vector embeddings for AI search
- `tags` and `contact_tags` - Organization and categorization
- `activities` - Comprehensive audit trail
- `communications` - Contact interaction history
- `leadgen_sessions` - AI generation tracking
- `scraped_customers` - Blacklist data
- `files` - Object storage metadata

## Development

### Local Development
